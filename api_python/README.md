## 📖 About the Project

Semantic review refers to the process of analyzing the meaning behind user reviews, often leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unlike simple keyword matching, semantic analysis attempts to understand the true intent, context, and emotions of the reviewer.
Tiki is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Vietnam, similar to Amazon or Shopee. It allows customers to purchase a wide range of products, from electronics to household items. Like other e-commerce platforms, Tiki has a review system where customers can leave feedback on products they have purchased.
